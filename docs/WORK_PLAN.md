# Work Plan

## Purpose

- Own the current slice, one next action, blockers, constraints, and deferred work.
- Keep phase, milestone, and Standard Calculation direction in `project_brief.md`.
- Keep milestone decisions and durable lessons in the log; keep conditional
  evidence in records and structural triggers in `docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.

## Update Rule

- This file is a near-term execution board, not a roadmap or task log.
- Update it only when the current slice, next action, blocker, constraint, or
  hold state changes.
- Do not append report lists, terminal output, or completed-action history.
- Add a Session Handoff only when the user explicitly requests one.

## Current Slice

Phase 5D Train/Model UI/UX is complete and merged. The user accepted repaired
head `a2ea64464e595d28d58db77a28d31eac60c6a72d` and authorized PR #31 closeout;
GitHub squash-merged it to `main` as
`78e9d097693c3e3b8c23d2ed18dd7e68dc1f44b0`. The first and second independent
audit `FAIL` results remain historical evidence, and no independent `PASS` is
retroactively declared. Phase 5D now owns the Candidate/Active Train surface,
dynamic Phase 5C result projection, explicit guarded promotion, rollback by
re-promotion, Bootstrap, current compatibility, fail-closed corruption, and
complete Korean rejection guidance. Exact-head validation run `30165774817`
succeeded. Phase 5B and Phase 5C remain complete and merged foundations.
The authoritative Phase 5 design is
`docs/designs/2026-07-22-train-model-lifecycle-agent-assisted-experiment-design.md`.
The earlier Phase 5 Train UI document remains supporting UI/UX guidance only;
the new design governs lifecycle, CLI, campaigns, the agent loop, migration, and
implementation order.

Phase 5E Deployment Export and Predict Reload Boundary is implemented on its
separate worker branch and remains unmerged. The first independent L4 audit
returned `FAIL` at exact head
`5364ff7a106f27975e649d44a3b0059509dc797e`: an older reload failure could
overwrite a newer successful reload state, and reload/export failures were not
structured or safely separated from raw diagnostics. The bounded repair adds a
monotonic application-owned reload operation guard and structured Korean
failure guidance while retaining raw diagnostics/traceback outside the default
message.
Predict now keeps a process-loaded Candidate/revision, observes current Active
without hot-swap, exposes explicit idle reload, and preserves the prior bundle
on corruption, incompatibility, recovery, running-state, or Active-race failure.
Train/Model can create a checksum-verified immutable export only from the
guarded current Active without changing Candidate, Active, or history. Phase 5D
promotion and rollback remain unchanged. CLI, Campaign, leaderboard, the
Agent-assisted Experiment Loop, retention, and executable packaging remain
later slices.

## Next Action

Preserve Phase 5E Draft PR #32 at the repaired exact worker head for independent
L4 re-audit. Keep the first audit `FAIL` and prior successful validation as
historical evidence. Do not merge or declare audit PASS from the worker. Keep
Phase 5F and later CLI, Campaign, leaderboard, Agent-assisted Experiment Loop,
retention, and packaging work unstarted.

## Active Blockers

- Model-incompatible Definition generations may publish and cut over, but Predict
  remains blocked with Retraining required until compatibility is proven. No model
  artifact is automatically replaced or promoted.
- Existing fixed-index Predict keys remain protected migration targets; saved
  user-created Features without those dependencies remain renameable/removable.
- Windows native Feature Manager smoke remains a pre-release verification item;
  automated macOS/offscreen coverage is not a substitute for that evidence.

## Active Constraints

- Preserve Data Definition as the canonical user-edit owner through one versioned
  structured JSON manifest. Exact path, package layout, DTO names, and field
  spelling are selected by Phase 4B after owner audit.
- Keep `config/predict/schema.csv`, `config/ml/features.csv`, Derived/One-hot,
  Target/registry, and Mapping requirements as generated compatibility or
  consumer projections rather than independent editors.
- Preserve the Data Definition/Data Mapping owner boundary and runtime
  `mapping.json` value contract.
- Preserve the accepted Qt-free draft, command, edit policy, projection,
  validation, save-plan, schema-writer, readiness, handoff, coverage, keyboard,
  focus, accessibility, and exact-navigation owners until their approved
  replacement or adapter is accepted.
- Use immutable stable identities independent of user-facing keys and ML names.
  Duplicate creates a new identity; Rename preserves identity and validates
  dependencies.
- Keep Predict display order, ordered ML contract, One-hot emitted order, Derived
  DAG order, and Target presentation order isolated.
- Publish immutable Definition generations through one all-or-nothing bundle and
  atomic active-generation pointer. Disk publication, consumer preflight, and
  runtime cutover remain distinct states.
- Require one active contract generation across required TrainShell consumers;
  preserve prior active generation and expose stale/restart-required after a
  failed preflight rather than allowing mixed normal state.
- Preserve active training-run snapshots and Data Mapping unsaved drafts across
  Definition changes. Do not classify stale artifacts as current-compatible.
- Separate training candidate publication from validated explicit active-model
  promotion, and distinguish TrainShell process-wide cutover from standalone
  Predict cross-process generation detection.
- Lifecycle state resolves beneath the user-state root through a stable workspace
  identity. A repository absolute path is not a permanent workspace identity,
  and the current foundation supports one default workspace only.
- Import an existing `model.pkl` as the initial Active model only when complete
  compatibility is proven. Otherwise preserve the original artifact and begin in
  Bootstrap / Retraining required state.
- Separate static/mapping-backed/external One-hot category mutation owners and
  Target CRUD from new model-group/model-level policy creation.
- Data Mapping remains the concrete `mapping.json` value owner; Train remains the
  explicit training-execution owner; Predict remains a saved-contract and
  compatible-model consumer.
- Phase 4 excludes automatic retraining, automatic promotion/activation, training
  execution from Data Definition, and Predict internal redesign.
- Use repository fixtures and mock data; do not add company production data or
  infer model quality or production readiness.
- Keep Cooling and Heating models independent, including monotone constraints.

## Deferred / Hold

- Phase 5F–5G CLI/campaign and agent-assisted loop work remains later than the
  lifecycle and Train/Model UI slices; it must not displace the UI/UX priority.
- Deferred Phase 2 native interaction acceptance remains a separate acceptance
  item and does not block Phase 5B.
- Predict internal UI/UX overhaul begins only after Train/Admin Phase 5 and a fresh
  populated-state audit.
- Real mapping values, training data, model quality, and production-readiness
  validation remain company-local.
